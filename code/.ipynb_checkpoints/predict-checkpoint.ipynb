He did something that no one could have imagined he‚Äôd be able to accomplish.  ‚ÄúI feel blessed just being part of the ride from day one and before. But he did something pretty remarkable. But I don‚Äôt profess to be a political savant. ‚Äù Donald Trump won the 2016 election in the electoral college, after a campaign marked by bitter partisan rancour and interference by Russian actors working, according to a Washington Post report last week, at the direct instruction of Vladimir Putin to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton. Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2. 5 million ballots. Ivanka Trump became a trusted lieutenant to her father, delivering a   convention speech in Cleveland in July and moving to Washington in January with her husband, Jared Kushner, who is one of the president‚Äôs closest advisers. Her White House position is unpaid. Though Trump claims to ‚Äústay out of politics‚Äù she has been a familiar surrogate for her father in the media and on the world stage. Earlier in June, she told Fox  Friends: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really focused on why the American people elected Donald Trump as their president and implementing that plan. ‚Äù Amidst congressional and FBI investigations into links between Trump aides and Russia and the reported investigation of her father for possible obstruction of justice related to those probes, she said then: ‚ÄúIt is hard, and there‚Äôs a level of viciousness that I was not expecting. I was not expecting the intensity of this experience, but this isn‚Äôt supposed to be easy. ‚Äù Asked in the interview broadcast on Monday if she ever disagreed with her father  ‚Äî   who has, for example, pursued policies on climate change, pulling out of the Paris agreement, that might be thought anathema to a registered New York Democrat, which she until recently was  ‚Äî   the first daughter said: ‚ÄúSo naturally, there are areas where there is disagreement. ‚Äù Climate change, with women‚Äôs rights, is part of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs White House brief. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre two different human beings,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs normal to not have 100% aligned viewpoints on every issue. I don‚Äôt think anyone operates like that with a parent, or within the context of an administration. ‚ÄúAnd I think that all different viewpoints being at the table is a positive thing. And I think one of the things that, in this country we don‚Äôt have enough of, is dialogue. ‚Äù \"\n",
